Adventure Go! is a puzzle solving game inspired by Helltaker but themed after the anime Konosuba. 
The game starts off with a short visual novel about a problem with our main character Kazuma and his companion Aqua. 
Kazuma used all of his money and now he has to look for treasures to make up for the losses. 
Will you be able to guide Kazuma to the treasures?
